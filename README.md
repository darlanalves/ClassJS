# Whapp Javascript Framework

This is minimalist package of Javascript to reuse in our projects.<br/>
The files are meant to be used as a base to create visual components, as well as reduce
code duplication in common tasks (modal windows, buttons...)

## Core
The core package provides a basic set of files with a class system and events support.

*Enjoy!*
